            Our story isn't about reinventing the wheel but about returning to a
            model that values growth, mentorship, and opportunity for all. Our
            goal is not to diverge from tradition but to preserve the ethos of
            accessibility and learning that seems to have been eclipsed in
            today's job market.{" "}

          As University of British Columbia alumni with a rich background in
          Mathematics, Computer Science, Psychology, and Economics, we embarked
          on our careers in an era that welcomed fresh graduates with open arms.
          This foundation allowed us to ascend through the ranks, from eager new
          developers to seasoned leaders in managerial positions. Reflecting on
          our journey over the past decade, we've witnessed a shifting
          landscapeâ€”one that increasingly favors senior expertise at the expense
          of nurturing new talent.

        <p className="hero__description">
          In founding Hooray!, we set out to challenge this prevailing trend,
          driven by a commitment to offer the supportive, opportunity-rich
          environment that was instrumental in our own development.
